# multiz
DNA multiple sequence aligner, official version from Penn State's Miller Lab

This is a copy of the tarball and documentation for multiz that was posted at
the Miller Lab website January 21, 2009, `http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab`.
The only changes are the addition of the README.md and the MIT license.
